# Brittany kelly 
## Hi!👋
I'm Brittany - a creative Software Developer with experience in CMS development and Marketing Sass Development. Passionate about problem-solving and collaborating between business, design, and development teams to bring concepts to life.

## 🛠️Career
My career has allowed me to work in a variety of CMSs (WordPress, Drupal, AEM) and scope out requirements for feature development. Also gaining a basic understanding of SEO to work as an intermediary between teams to get results and decrease the amount of back and forth between teams. 

Understanding complex systems and digging into how things work is a joy of mine.

Sharing knowledge is also a large part of my career. I've had the opportunity to speak to people breaking out into the tech field, mentor junior developers, and give presentations/lunch and learns at my jobs. I'm working on creating this content to share through my blog to reach even more audiences that may benefit from it.
